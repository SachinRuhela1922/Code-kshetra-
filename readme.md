Pricing Optimization with Reinforcement Learning

This repository demonstrates how to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize product pricing and maximize sales based on historical price and sales data. The RL model predicts the ideal price for a product, balancing between exploring new price points and exploiting historical data to maximize future sales.

Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to predict the optimal product price using Reinforcement Learning. The RL model uses historical data (product price, sales, and conversion rates) to find an ideal pricing strategy that maximizes sales. The model rewards higher sales and conversion rates and penalizes for underperformance.

The agent will:

Explore price adjustments.

Exploit optimal prices based on historical data.

Maximize total sales and conversion rates.

Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pricing-optimization-rl.git
cd pricing-optimization-rl

Step 2: Install Dependencies

Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

If requirements.txt is not available, you can manually install the necessary dependencies:

pip install numpy pandas

Step 3: Download the Data

Download the CSV file containing the historical price and sales data from Google Drive:

Download the CSV file

After downloading, place the CSV file in the project directory.

Step 4: Modify the File Path

In the Python code, update the path to the CSV file. For example:

data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_file.csv')

Change 'path_to_your_file.csv' to the actual file path of the CSV file.

Running the Project

Step 1: Train the Model

Once the environment is set up, you can train the model using the following command:

python train_model.py

This will:

Load the CSV data.

Preprocess it for use in the Reinforcement Learning model.

Train the RL model using Q-learning.

Optimize pricing strategy.


Step 2: Test the Model

After training, you can test the model and get the optimal price predictions for the next day:

python test_model.py

This will use the learned Q-values to predict the ideal price based on the historical data.

Key Components

1. PricingEnvironment: The environment where the agent interacts with the historical data.


2. Q-Learning Algorithm: The reinforcement learning algorithm used to train the model.


3. Rewards System: The reward is calculated based on sales, conversion rates, and penalties for lower performance.


4. Data Preprocessing: The CSV file is preprocessed for use in training the RL agent.



Dependencies

numpy: For numerical operations.

pandas: For data manipulation and reading the CSV file.


Install the dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Alternatively, install them individually:

pip install numpy pandas
